# Hypersonic
Fly through space at the speed of music.

# Note
If you're using a Mac you need to download the XBOX controller driver from here: https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases

## Gameplay
The Hypersonic Drive is fueled by music. Each stage is a song track, and every ship going through hyperspace has two fields of play to focus on to keep fuel up:

### Nodes
Musical sources of energy, or nodes, stream past via 3 lanes. Hit up, middle, or down when they reach the target line to vaporize them and gain fuel. Some nodes have sustains that require you to hold them! As you hit the nodes, your ship will harvest energy using various sonic weapons.

### Traces
You don't have to move your ship to hit the nodes. Instead, there are glowing trails to follow with the ship... while still hitting those nodes. Sometimes, the traces don't have length, and are simply gates to pass through.
